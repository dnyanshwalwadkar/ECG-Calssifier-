# ECG-Classifier-


tThe electrocardiogram (ECG) signal basically corresponds to the electrical activity of the heart.
In theliterature, the ECG signal has been analyzed and utilized for various purposes, such as measuring theheart rate,
examining the rhythm of heartbeats, diagnosing heart abnormalities, emotion recognition andbiometric identification. 
ECG analysis (depending on the type of the analysis) can contain several steps,such as preprocessing, feature extraction, 
feature selection, feature transformation and classification.Performing each step is crucial for the sake of the related analysis.
In addition, the employed successmeasures and appropriate constitution of the ECG signal database play important roles in the 
analysisas well.
